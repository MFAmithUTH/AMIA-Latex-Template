AMIA Latex example
------------------

From the files available in the zip file:

amia.cls is a latex class file to produce a PDF in the format required by AMIA.

amia.tex is a latex document which can be used as example of use of amia.cls.
In addition, the text in this file contains details about the AMIA format requirements.
It is important to keep the bibliography style "unsrt" so the references follow the citation order.

You can find further information about the format requirements under the following link in the section "File Format Requirements".

https://www.amia.org/amia2011/proposals

If you use dvipdf to produce the final PDF, margins might not follow the instructions of the template.
You are advised to use "dvipdfm -p letter" instead.

We have tried to produce a good approximation to the AMIA format requirements.
Please check the final produced PDF before submitting your paper to AMIA.
